## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create a application to practice what you have learned in React.js!

This will be an application to consume data from the repositories of your portfolio using the application of Node.js that was created at [challenge 02](https://github.com/antoniowd/gostack-challenge-02). 

### Application requirements

- **List the repositories of your API**: You should be able to create a list with the **title** field of all the repositories that are registered in your API.

- **Add a repository to your API**: You must be able to add a new item to your API via a button with the text *Adicionar* and, after creation, you must be able to display its name after registration.

- **Remove a repository from your API**: For each item in your list, you must have a button with the text *Remover* which, when you click, will call a function to remove that item from the list of your frontend and your API.
